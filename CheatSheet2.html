		<h1>WWW and HTML</h1>
		
		Void Elements only have a start tag, because they have no content
		<br/><br/>
		HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag like(href, style). 
		<br/><br/>
		The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the "html" tag.
		<br/><br/>
		The "article" tag specifies independent, self-contained content.<br/>
		The "body" tag defines the document's body.<br/>
		The "br/" tag inserts a single line break.<br/>
		The "h1" to "h6" tags are used to define HTML headings.<br/>
		The "title" element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents.<br/>
		The "html" tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document / represents the root of an HTML document / is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).<br/>
		The "p" tag defines a paragraph.<br/>
		The "section" tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.<br/>
		The "a" tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.<br/>
		
		<h2> CSS </h2>
			
		The CSS rule has contents like selector, declaration, property and value<br/>
		A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.<br/>

		There are four different combinators in CSS:<br/>
		descendant selector (space)<br/>
		child selector (>)<br/>
		adjacent sibling selector (+)<br/>
		general sibling selector (~)<br/><br/>
		Hue Hex		Rgb				Hsl <br/>
		0 	#ff0000	rgb(255, 0, 0)	hsl(0, 100%, 50%)<br/><br/>
		
		Deklaration: "body text ="white"" "body bgcolor="black"" <br/>
					  
		A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
		The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element. By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element. <br/>
		
		The text-align property specifies the horizontal alignment of text in an element. <br/>
		
		The text-decoration property specifies the decoration added to text, and is a shorthand property for: text-decoration-line (required), text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style <br/>
		The text-transform property controls the capitalization of text. <br/>
		Serifs are the (more or less) fine line that ends a letter at the end, transverse to its basic direction / Sans Serifs are in one thick line <br/>
		The font-family property specifies the font for an element. <br/>
